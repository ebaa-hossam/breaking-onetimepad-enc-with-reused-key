# breaking-onetimepad-enc-with-reused-key
One-Time Pad (OTP) encryption is theoretically unbreakable when used properly. However, This code describes a method for breaking OTP encryptions. The code takes advantage of the fundamental weakness of reusing OTP keys, and knowing a small part of the plaintext, this can be leveraged to break the encryption.
